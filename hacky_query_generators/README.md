Hacky DNS query generation scripts
==================================

Because who doesn't love crap code written out of necessity? All code in this directory is junk shell scripts I've written for testing purposes. This code probably shouldn't be used for anything. Alas, I must start somewhere. All scripts generate DNS queries to 8.8.8.8 beacuse google doesn't return an ad landing page (a DNS lie) instead of a true NXDomain response. All scripts attempt to generate queries at random intervals.

algo_nxd_query_generator.sh - my attempt at simulating queries similar to those generated by DGA malware. A domain is generated based on an epoch
legit_query_generator.sh - a script that will generate queries for some popular legit domains (and two unpopular legit domains)
legit_misspelled_query_generator.sh - a copy of the legit_query_generator script with misspellings introduced
random_nxd_query_generator.sh - me mashing on the keyboard attempting to create random domains to query that will return NXDomain responses but aren't based on any sort of algo pattern
dns_queries.pcap - I ran all the above scripts and collected the pcap, just for you :)

These scripts need to all be rewritten. I like to run them all as background processes and start up Bro on a single network interface.
